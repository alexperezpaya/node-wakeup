node-wakeup
===========

A node app to run to use to do tasks at wake up, e.g, reading your feed in voice api, check email, calendar, tasklist, tweets, etc. Right now work in progress and just for hackers!

Now doing Mac support, but want to include Linux and Win (yes, sucks, but we are not going to discriminate them)
